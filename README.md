# Cleaning_Data
During this project, I focused on ensuring the quality and reliability of our data through meticulous cleaning and preparation:
Data Integrity: Ensured accuracy, consistency, and reliability throughout the cleaning process, establishing a solid foundation for analysis.
Missing Data Handling: Dealt with missing values by either imputing them or making informed decisions to handle gaps effectively.
Duplicate Removal: Identified and eliminated duplicate records to maintain the uniqueness and integrity of the dataset.
Standardization: Implemented consistent formatting and units across the dataset to ensure accuracy in subsequent analyses.
Outlier Detection: Identified and addressed outliers to prevent skewed analysis and improve model performance.

Key Achievements:
Established robust data integrity protocols.
Enhanced dataset reliability by effectively handling missing values and duplicates.
Standardized data for uniformity and consistency.
Improved analysis accuracy by addressing outliers.
